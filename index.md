# Saraii's Portfolio

My name is Saraii Roa and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton. I am a computer science major that expects to graduate in 2027.

## CPSC 120 Labs
*lab 2, part 1

This computer lab was interesting because it explored the basics of C++, specifically arithmetic operators and operator precedence rules. The lab challenged us to employ integer variables in a program to decipher a formula, highlighting the importance of using the 'int' type to store calculation results. 

*lab 4, part 2

I loved this computer science lab because it introduced a fun guessing game where one player chooses a secret number, and the other player tries to guess it. The lab challenged us to create the game ourselves without a specific set of instructions, encouraging problem-solving using if statements. 

*lab 6, part 2

I found this computer science lab fascinating because it introduced the game of Blackjack and outlined its rules in a clear and detailed manner. The lab task involved creating a program that computes the score of two given cards based on Blackjack rules, using command line arguments.
